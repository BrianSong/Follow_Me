# Udacity_RoboND_Follow_Me
*In this project, A quadrotor can identify a female target hero from crowd and follow her. The identification task is achieved by semantic segmentation in fully convolutional networks (FCN). Moreover, the quadrotor is controlled by PID that will be also discussed in this `README.md`.*

**Python with TensorFlow and Keras** are used for implementing this project and **Unity** is used for simulating the enviroment.

This is a `README` that includes all the key points and how I addressed each one.

**Steps to complete the project:**  


1. Clone the project repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DeepLearning-Project.git).
2. Fill out the TODO's in the project code.
3. Optimize your network and hyper-parameters.
4. Train your network and achieve an accuracy of 40% (0.40) using the Intersection over Union IoU metric which is final_grade_score at the bottom of your notebook.
